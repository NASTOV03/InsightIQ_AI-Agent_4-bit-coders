# 🧠 InsightIQ - AI-Powered Cognitive Companion&#x20;

InsightIQ is an advanced **Agentic AI Assistant** powered by IBM Watsonx and grounded with vectorized knowledge to deliver high-context, intelligent, and insightful answers. Designed as a foundational prototype for educational and knowledge-enhancing use cases, it leverages **LLaMA 3 Vision-Instruct (11B)** to create an always-available, vision-aware AI assistant. 🚀🤖

## 🧩 SMART CONTEXTUAL INTELLIGENCE FOR REAL-TIME USE

### 📌 Overview

InsightIQ is an experimental IBM Watsonx-powered AI assistant using the **meta-llama/llama-3-2-11b-vision-instruct** model. It is enhanced through **vector-based knowledge retrieval** using a PDF knowledge base, making it capable of **deep contextual understanding** across multi-turn conversations.

Whether you're a researcher, student, or developer—InsightIQ helps you query data-rich documents in natural language with grounded, AI-generated responses.

### 🚀 Features

🔍 **Vision + Language Intelligence**
Understands and processes visual inputs and text with LLaMA 3 Vision-Instruct.

🧠 **Agentic Reasoning Engine**
Driven by IBM Watsonx Agentic AI lab with pre-built tools, steps, and functions for intelligent conversations.

📚 **Vectorized Knowledge Base**
PDF files are uploaded, vectorized, and used to ground responses—ensuring factual accuracy from trusted documents.

🔁 **Memory-like Contextual Flow**
Supports multi-turn conversations using Watsonx agentic flows.
